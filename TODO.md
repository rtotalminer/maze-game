### v0.0.1
For version v0.0.1 the game should be at a playable state as it was supposed to be, there may be minor glitches with NPCs, and a few code files will be messy with text data, but until a map editor/creator will be made (hopefully) to allow for quick creation of map data and storage of it and therefore reading of it will be less imiportant.  When v0.0.1 is released the game will be semi-stable with not many features but some basic wil be established, such as map loading, code understanding and texture loading.

- [~] Add an animated menu screen with an option for a map maker.
- [~] Fix texture loading.
- [~] Add easy-to-edit configuration w/ room loading as it currently is.
- [~] Modulate the code in the main.js, settings.js etc..
