### v0.1.1
For version v0.0.1 the game should be at a playable state as it was supposed to be, there may be minor glitches with NPCs, and a few code files will be messy with text data, but until a map editor/creator will be made (hopefully) to allow for quick creation of map data and storage of it and therefore reading of it will be less imiportant.  When v0.0.1 is released the game will be semi-stable with not many features but some basic wil be established, such as map loading, code understanding and texture loading.

- [x] Add an animated menu screen with an option for a map maker.
- [x] Fix texture loading.
- [~] Add easy-to-edit configuration w/ room loading as it currently is.
- [~] Refactor the code in the main.js, settings.js, menu.js etc..

### v0.1.2
Minor development patches and tweaks.

- [x] Add .gitignore.
- [~] Restructure index.html and server.js to /game/

### v1.0.0
The game mechanics will pretty much be the exact same in all previous version, but it should be playable, when I mean playable I mean textures load properly, no determentral bugs and the game simply 'works' - the user can go from start to finish in the game, play with all it's features and be without any major bugs.

 
### v2.0.0
Version 2.0.0 codename 'far away' because seems like it will come in the distant future of Neverland... This version will come with smooth and dynamiic camera movement for an open-world experience.

- [~] Implement open world mapping.
- [~] Implement dynamic camera.

### v3.0.0
I muust be high!

- [x] Multiplayer!
