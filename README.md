## Introduction
A stranded adventurer awoken in a mysterious dungeon inhabitated by fearless zombies and generous quest-giving creatures has to gain a large fortune and escape!

## How to play
The goal of the game is to escape and accumilate as much money as you can, on the web page in the bottom left there is a tooltip, but here is a summary of the controls:
 - Move with 'WASD'
 - Interact with NPCs with the 'spacebar'
 - Open the inventory with 'I'
 - Press 'ESC' to pause.

## Pre-release notes
This game is by far no where near to a complete game, but it contains a few minutes of fun and an opportunity to show of my project, here are some obvious bugs and lack of features you may encounter:
 - The texture such as walls and floors may not correctly spawn on an initial load, just refresh the page until it does.
 - Zombies could glitch you through walls - either breaking the game or transferring you to a different room.
 - The map is incomplete, there are only 2 quests and 1 door, with a poor designed ending screen and menu.
